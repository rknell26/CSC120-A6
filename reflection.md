- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
It makes it easier to group similar classes and have them function in similar ways.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
The concept of 'Inheritance' worked really well for me, and I was able to code all the methods. Don't forget to look at Building.java when you need to use its methods for a child class!
